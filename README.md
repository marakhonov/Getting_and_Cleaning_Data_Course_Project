# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project
This file contains the codebook for the output.txt generated by run_analysis.R script which was whritten for The Course Project in Getting and Cleaning Data course at Data Science Specialization at Coursera.

Output file contains mean and standart deviations of several parameters from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. This Data Set was obtained during the experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the authors captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The script called run_analysis.R was written that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
variable for each activity and each subject.

The pipeline of the script is depicted in a Figure 1.
